# Battery Status Script

## Space Engineers

This is a script for the game Space Engineers. You can put this script into a 
programable block. Just do it by copy paste. See the instructions for more 
informations.

## Notice

This is a modified version of the original Battery Status Script in version
1.1 [Vanilla] from Lightwolf Adventures. Currently the last update was of
his script was at 8 Jan. 2018. So, there are some issues with this script.
Therefore I have modified this script to bring it into the current game
version.

You can find the original script here: https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=1238124032

## Instructions

I use the MDK from https://github.com/malware-dev/MDK-SE. The code is written
inside the community version of Visual Studio. Therefore you can find the
script under the BatteryStatus folder. Open the file Program.cs to view the
hole code.

If you want a copy'n paste version open file Release_Version in the root
directory. Select the hole content, copy it to your clipboard, switch to
Space Engineers and paste the code into your programable block.
