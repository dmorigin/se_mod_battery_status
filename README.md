# Battery Status Script

This script is designed to run inside a programmable block of Space Engineers. Use it if you want to watch over your batteries. This script generates an overview of all your batteries and visualize it on a surface.

## Space Engineers

Space Engineers is a Game developed by Keen Software House. You can find more details about Keen Software House at his official 
Web Site at https://www.keenswh.com/. Or visit his forum directly at https://forums.keenswh.com/.

## Instructions

I use the MDK from https://github.com/malware-dev/MDK-SE. The code is written
inside the community version of Visual Studio. Therefore you can find the
script under the BatteryStatus folder. Open the file Program.cs to view the
hole code.

The best way to use this script is over the steam workshop. You find it here: https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=1687643514. If you don't want that, use the code directly. In this case you need to copy the code inside the Program.cs file and paste this into your programmable block.

## Remarks

this is a complete rewrite of the hole code. I have started it because of the changes of the text panels, that now integrate a little Sprite Engine. This version comes with a couple of features. I will tell you later about these. You don't find this version in the steam workshop currently, because it is in a working progress. I will publish a version if I have a first stable version.
